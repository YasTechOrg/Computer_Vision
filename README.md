In this guide we will learn how to peform image classification and object detection/recognition using deep computer vision with something called a convolutional neural network.

The goal of our convolutional neural networks will be to classify and detect images or specific objects from within the image. We will be using image data as our features and a label for those images as our label or output.

We already know how neural networks work so we can skip through the basics and move right into explaining the following concepts:

- Image Data

- Convolutional Layer

- Pooling Layer

- CNN Architectures
